# chrome_extension_project
The project was inspired by the endless amount of clickbait available on the internet at the moment. Our project hopes to make a dent in this growing problem. 
Our mission statement is to help clean up the internet one clickbait at a time. The way we do this is by giving the power back to the users.
FlickBait is designed to aggregate users votes and give back an average rating as a percentage(or other) for specific urls. 
The users themselves will have the ability to promote or discourage others from exploring the url by voting and making an impact.
